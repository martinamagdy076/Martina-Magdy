            <h2>360 degree product photography</h2>
            <p>
                360 Product Photography is an advanced form of product photography that is used to better visually communicate products online. It involves capturing a 360 product image set then ‘stitching’ the images together into an interactive 360 product animation that allows people to rotate and zoom to inspect product details from every angle.

Iconasys 360 Product Photography Equipment, Turntables & Software are trusted by some the world’s largest brands, retailers, professional photographers along with over 7,000 small to medium size businesses worldwide. We not only offer the most comprehensive and professional solutions for creating 360 product photography, but also the fastest, easiest and best value solutions. Iconasys 360 Product Photography Software, Turntables and Light Box’s are designed for users of any skill level to create high-quality, web-ready 360 product views.
Creating 360 degree product photography involves capturing a set of still images as an object rotates over a 360-degree plane. Images are captured at even and precise rotation intervals (ex. one capture every 10-degrees to create a 360 product image set of 36 frames) and the resulting 360 product image set is composed into a 360 product spin file that can be used in product display online. Typically, 360 product spins support interactivity (click-and-drag, deep zoom) – providing customers the ability to rotate, view and inspect the product virtually from any angle. The more frames captured in the 360 image set, the more fluid the 360 product rotation will be.
360° Product Photography is one of the fastest growing trends in digital commerce. We have seen thousands of brands and retailers implement these as well as leading marketplaces such as Amazon and Walmart.com encourage sellers to provide a 360 view for their product listings. Studies have highlighted the benefits of using 360 product views to compliment product listings and online sales efforts with the general consensus being:

    Increased Conversion Rates: Images sell products online. 360 product photography is a better form of product image as it provides more visual feedback. Brands & retailers experience increased conversion rates after implementing 360 product photography (in some cases by up to 45%)
    Decreased Product Returns: Buyers are able to see, virtually touch and inspect an object from any angle. This helps to ensure customers know exactly what they are getting before making a purchase thus, reducing return rates
    Brand Recognition: Online sellers are constantly searching for ways to enhance the online shopping experience. 360 product views bridge the gap between virtual and reality and will encourage higher brand recognition and repeat customers.
    …and ultimately, Increased Profits (learn more about The Value of 360 Product Photography)

According to a Big Commerce Study, 78% of online shoppers want photographs to bring products to life. With 360 product photography, virtual merges with reality and gives the customer a chance to interact with the product. In addition to the benefits eCommerce and Online Sellers receive, we have also seen a strong demand for 360 degree product photography in business communication (product design & development), quality control and presentations. The underlying concept: The more effectively businesses are able to visually communicate products in the online space, the better. 360 Product Photography will help you do just that.
